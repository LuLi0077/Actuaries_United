# Insurance Analytics (draft-please edit)

This is intended to collect useful functions and features in insurance analytics so:

* modelers do not need to reinvent the wheel;
* it helps speeding up the data-to-action process;
* we can all share experiences and best practices. 

An initial structure of the folders is here:

* Data transformation
* Data visulization
* Data exploration
* Feature generation
* Feature selection
* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning
* Deep learning
* Natural language processing (NLP)
* Model validation
* FAQ 

More detials are included in the `README.md` in each subfolder. Some of these modules can be used across different areas of insurance practices (e.g. pricing, reserving, claim etc.), some might be more function specific. We might restructure the folders to reflect that. 

General rules of everything included in this repo:
* only open source softwares are used;
* introduction and comments are presented in each sub-function;
* multiple implementations might be available;
* approaches and examples are insurance specific.
